#
# De::SunspotSolr operator classes: And and Or
#
# De::SunspotSolr module provides engine to build, validate and evaluate dynamic sunspot query to solr
# based on some model.
# It is built as extension of De module
#
# SunspotSolr expression example:
#
# Sunspot.search(Product) do
#   any_of do
#     with(:client_id).equal_to(43)
#     with(:name).equal_to('Name to trace')
#   end
#   with(:update_time).greater_then('2011-03-15 00:15:00')
# end
